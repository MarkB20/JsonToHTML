Hi Pierre we have the converter done you just need to change the input and output file to where you want to convert and send the html. the stylesheet can be changed to be anything if you don't like the design.  https://github.com/MarkB20/JsonToHTML

Hey guys, with a couple minor adjustments, I was able to run your script locally.

The resulting HTML pages look like so - is that expected?

that is what it would look like without the stylesheet being copied over into the file so there is a bug there, but roughly yep

I see the CSS got copied over

Didn't see any reference to the CSS from the HTML files

Ah ok.  Yeah, no luck for me with the stylesheet.  Tried with both Chrome and Firefox

so i take it there is no link tag wrapping the html fils then? me and tom will test a couple of different ways then to see if we can get the same error, also out of curiosity what did you change or was it just the config file. thanks for having a look

so we look over what could be wrong and we think it could be the the fact that since the beutifulsoup4 is an external library you may need to install it since it is used to add the link tag to the html. 

also we were think if that is the case, we should add that to the read me or have a script that checks or runs an install for the script. or some other way around it
